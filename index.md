### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
Part 1 of Lab 8 was one of my favorites because as a kid I loved to do Mad Libs with my siblings. And working through this lab brought me back to those childhood memories. I was able to identify how patterns are used in programming and how I can write input code to produce varying output.  
   
    
* Lab 9
Lab 9, part 1 was enjoyable to me because it dealt with the olympics and competition, which is an area Iâ€™ve been interested in my whole life. This part of the lab taught me how to calculate averages, while simultaneously leaving out certain values like the maximum and minimum.


* Lab 10
In Lab 10, part 2 my favorite part was witnessing how programming can be used to organize data with ease. It also taught me how to work smarter with programming. In this lab we used strings to combine two vectors that compare population data.
